# FIR Analysis using AI/ML Model

## Overview

Welcome to the FIR Analysis project! This project utilizes AI/ML models for the analysis of First Information Reports (FIRs) based on the relevant acts and sections. The goal is to provide an efficient and automated approach to extract key information from FIRs using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow the instructions below:

### Backend

1. Open the `config` file to set up the necessary configurations.
2. Run the following command to start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will initiate the backend server, and you'll see logs indicating the server is running.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run the following command to start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will launch the frontend application, and you can access it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, and relevant libraries for AI/ML integration.
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **Machine Learning**: State-of-the-art models for natural language processing and information extraction.

## Project Structure

- `backend`: Contains the backend server code.
- `frontend`: Includes the React.js code for the user interface.
- `models`: Houses the trained AI/ML models for FIR analysis.
- `config`: Configuration files for setting up the backend.
